* is the world mutable or immutable?
** immutability is a property of observers, not the state itself
** vipassana will make one question the nature of time
** how does cause and effect work?
*** I change something at time A
*** it remains changed at time B (now, where A is its filtered history)
*** the filtered history has become the future where B either remains or affects events at C
* an external observer (martin thompson perf measurements) vs the observed being the observer
** for introspection, the latter is necessary
** requires tight feedback loop
* different meditation techniques:
** yogic sleep
** thich naht han
** thai forest
** zazen
** vipassana
* paradox in itself, resolving paradoxes
** causing pain, resolving pain
** how can everything be simultaneously true and untrue?
** "how can you stop the sound"? -- koan practice
** truly turtles all the way down (no JVM underneath)
** free will; a pure exercise of will that
* need to suspend disbelief x 3:
** the tight connection between nervous system and brain in the brain's behaviour (the futurama head-in-a-jar seems unlikely or impossible)
** focused attention (meditation) is a thing
** dissolution of the body

** english classes: notion of "self" (identity)

* nervous sytem + brain observed by "attention", self-defined as the nervous system + brain in the next slide
* buddhist ideas of "craving", "aversion", and "attachment" can be framed in the 5 - 8 sense system:
** normal 5: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch
** expanded: "touch" of nerves, thoughts (a) participatory, and (b) observed
