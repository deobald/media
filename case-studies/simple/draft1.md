# Case Study: Simple.org

Simple.org is a story about scale. On the one hand, the tagline "the fast, free app for clinicians to manage their patients with high blood pressure" describes a small mobile app with a singular purpose. On the other hand, Simple's mission is to save the millions of lives currently lost every year to heart attack and stroke. That's a mission which implies huge networks and thousands of moving parts. Can one little app save millions of lives? Certainly not on its own.

## The Problem

When _Resolve to Save Lives_ approached nilenso in May of 2018, the problem they had in hand was seemingly straight-forward: Build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the Simple app and start showing it to users. But even as we claim "build an MVP" to be the problem statement we start to see the different scales at which this project operates. Yes, it's true that the initial task could be summed up as "build an MVP" but from _Resolve's_ perspective, the initial-initial task was actually "find a consulting company in India to build an MVP." Although "Simple" was a front-runner, the product didn't even have a name yet.

Every paid consultant has gone through the "Five Whys" exercise. The exercise is easy: ask "why?" of the problem at hand, then ask "why?" of the answer you uncover. Repeat five times. This exercise often makes inexperienced consultants come across like curious, but incredibly annoying, three-year-olds. When consulting with an organization like _Resolve_, the exercise isn't actually necessary. Or, at least, it's not obviously necessary.

The first meeting at the nilenso office was with Daniel Burka, Director of Product and Design at _Resolve._ The most common appraisal Daniel had among nilenso staff who hadn't met him yet was "the guy who designed the Firefox logo." For those who had started careers early enough to witness the early days of the Firefox web browser, this was no specious laurel. Firefox represented far more than the buzzwords we associate with it today: Open Source, Free Software, a World Wide Web based on Open Standards. Back in 2003, Firefox represented the democratization of the web in a David v. Goliath fight against Microsoft's stagnant and underperforming Internet Explorer, universally hated by software developers the world over. Firefox sat in the intersection of two communities, two ideas. On the left was _Free Software_. On the right was _Design_ With a Capital D. Good Design meant that a product like Firefox had to be approached with Design Thinking. It had to have a brand. It had to be sexy. It had to be so much better than everything else you would be a fool not to use it. Firefox was all these things. It was also a Javascript debugger, a CSS reverse-engineering tool, and the doorway millions of developers stepped through to create the web and the internet we all rely on today. The significance of such a tool, and such a brand, is not to be understated. So come, meet Daniel, the guy who designed the Firefox logo.

No one from nilenso remembers a conversation about the Firefox logo but everyone who attended those early meetings remembers that the "why" of the project was very much understood. As far as _Resolve's_ goals were concerned, the "Five Whys" exercise would hardly be necessary. Why was _Resolve_ talking to nilenso? We heard your team was very good and we want to validate that by building an MVP. Why an MVP? We need to build real software, get it in front of our first users in Punjab, and start collecting feedback. Why build this software? Millions of preventable deaths happen worldwide every year due to heart attack and stroke. Many of those deaths aren't only preventable but _easily_ preventable. Some countries have this right, some don't. We want to build the tool that will help everyone on the planet prevent these deaths. Why hypertension? What's so special about heart attack and stroke? There are hundreds of possible candidates for attention at this scale, but hypertension is at the top of a lot of lists: It causes a massive number of deaths. It is easy to prevent with simple protocols and affordable medicines. It is well understood --- we aren't waiting for a miracle cure or scientific breakthrough; we just need to help nurses and doctors support their patients.

The reasoning was sound. The project made sense. _Resolve_ and nilenso had barely begun discussions and the team was already excited to get to work. But a project as exciting as Simple permits further reflection. We can turn the "Five Whys" on ourselves.

---

Deepa Venkatraman and Steven Deobald, who paired [^1] on project management for Simple, found out early in their working relationship that they shared a common friend in Avishek Sengupta --- affectionately known as "Mojo" to them both. 

This triangle of working relationships was almost perfectly symmetrical. Mojo and Deepa built a robot together for a college project in TODO:year and Deepa and Steven began working together in 2016. In 2006, Steven and Mojo were pairing on some legacy Java code in a tiny office in downtown Vancouver.

Mojo turned to Steven:

"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."

Steven answered with a blank stare.

"Gandalf?" Mojo offered. "Fellowship of the Ring? I just re-read the books. That's sort of... the highest problem statement philosophically possible, isn't it?"

It was common to bump up against such peculiar insights when pairing with Mojo. The Java code in front of him was rarely the most intriguing thing on Mojo's mind during any given workday. At the time, it didn't feel as though this particular insight was going to define the creation of an entire company.

“I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.
"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. There are other forces at work in this world [, Frodo, besides that of evil.]”

Mojo on the "highest possible problem statement".
