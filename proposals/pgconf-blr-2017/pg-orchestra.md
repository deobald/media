# A Postgres Orchestra
_by Akshay Gupta_

## Abstract

Design a postgres clustering ecosystem that is easy to maintain, fault-tolerant and painless for application developers

## Description

We go over replication strategies, failure scenarios, automatic failovers, clustering and keeping our cluster highly available at a large scale. Instead of describing the failure scenarios theoretically, we will replay them in real-time on our local machines and test the resiliency of the solutions presented. The majority of this talk will attempt to keep the clustering system self-reliant and allow the application code to be sufficiently isolated from the database system while still providing an accessible mechanism that is easy to monitor and tweak. We will also examine the problem of correctly broadcasting the current master and go over some techniques that will help monitor the health of our cluster.

## Outline

Each step below has a tentative time it would take to cover the topic.

### Introduction to clustering and replication [5 min]

* Introduce the basic cluster setup with one master and one standby
* Briefly go through synchronous and asynchronous streaming replication

### Docker Setup [5 min]

* This will not assume any prior knowledge about docker â€“ we won't go into detail about how it works. We'll just use it to test and showcase our scenarios.
* Setup a postgres cluster with docker.
* Introduce `tc` and blockade[1] to create network latency, arbitrary network partitions, packet drops etc. While still maintaining connection to the host to monitor the health.
* Showcase some quick `pgbench` scripts to simulate slow/fast read and writes


### Repmgr [5 min]

* Briefly explain how repmgr works
* Go through various non-obvious gotchas that one should be aware of
* Automating parts of repmgr
	* Scripting various events
	* Electing synchronous standbys
* Compare repmgr with other tools like Patroni[2] or Stolon[3]

### Failures (a.k.a disasters) [10 m]

* Go through some high-level failures:
	* Out of disk space
	* Too many connections
	* High network latency
	* Network partitions
	* Partial network partitions
	* Accidental truncates
	* Actual disasters
* Establish some effective scenarios they may cause to our cluster:
	* Mulitple masters or no masters
	* Unreachable nodes
	* Failed failovers

### Governance [10 min]
* Solve the problem of discovering and broadcasting the latest master
    - Using Zookeeper / etcd to store the latest master and preventing writing stale masters
    - Split-brain and how witness servers can help in providing a voting majority.
    - Using Agrajag[4] to do all of the above
    - Compare Agrajag with other tools like Patroni and Stolon

### Load Balancers [10 m]

* Describe how we can put the clusters behind HAProxy / PGPool / Keepalived and UCARP
* Compare use-cases and scenarios for each mechanism
* Discuss how a Virtual IP mechanism may not be the silver bullet after all
* Contrast the benefits of having a Layer 4 load balancer with Layer 7 

### Connection Pooling [5 m]

* Compare application-level pooling (like Hikari or BoneCP) with tools such as PgPool
* See why systems sometimes can't do away with app-level pooling

### Backup Strategies [5 m]

* Run down a priority list of backup strategies
* Go through Logical Backups, Filsystems Backups (showcase on btrfs and zfs), Standbys
* Explain Barman
* Describe a sample configuration of good practical geographic configurations of all the recovery mechanisms
