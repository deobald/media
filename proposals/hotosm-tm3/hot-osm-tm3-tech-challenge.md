# HOT OSM Task Manager 3 Tech Challenge #

# Application: Nilenso Software LLP #


## Introduction ##

Throughout this application, we hope to address all questions and concerns outlined in the Task Manager 3 (TM3) Tech Challenge (TM3TC). Our team is familiar with HOT, participates in the OpenStreetMap community, and is particularly well-equipped to handle the both the technical and non-technical challenges of the TM3TC. Our company also has a very specific vision of progressively delivering more of our work as open source, preferably around open data, with each project we take on. When we evaluate, sell, and staff projects at nilenso it is rare to come across one so well-aligned as this. We are very excited to apply to the challenge!

We have arranged our application in a slightly different order than the format of the TM3TC document or the project Terms of Reference (ToR). Because it affects absolutely every aspect of the project, collaboration and communication is mentioned multiple times in both of these documents. We feel this is a key issue, and we have started our application with this topic and how we plan to address it.

After collaboration, we brief our company's skillsets and then dive into our experience in, and approach to, project management, design, and development. We intend to staff people from each of these three roles on this project.

Finally, we will directly address how we will achieve the goals outlined in the TM3TC and present our company's qualifications for taking on such a project.
