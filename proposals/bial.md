# Proposal for BLR Airport App #

## Introduction ##
We are very excited to put forth our proposal for the maintenance and extension of the BLR Airport App. Per our discussions with the product owners, we intend to take an incremental approach to improving the usability and functionality of the existing app.

In this proposal, we aim to demonstrate:

- our ability to research and design applications in a manner that offer an immediate benefit to the user, 
- our capabilities in the development of mobile applications, as well as
- our expertise with respect to project management and attention to detail

We do this by taking two representative examples: 
a) Redesigning the Flight Tracking feature, and 
b) Building a Contextual Search feature across the various service providers at the airport (including but not limited to the airport, airlines, restaurants, and transport providers).

Please note: The proposed features mentioned in this document are intended to give you an idea about our user-centric approach. The trajectory of the application in the future will depend on the features identified and prioritised after discussions (including research, prototyping, and testing) with the various stakeholders involved. 

## Approach ##

### Development ###

Our development style is familiar to most of our potential clients. Test-Driven Development (TDD), continuous integration/deployment, and pair programming are hallmarks of any competent software engineering firm in 2017. Developers at nilenso strive to excel beyond this, however.

Over the past 3 years, we have built distributed systems which handle many terrabytes of data per month, we have tested these systems using progressive testing strategies such as simulation and generative testing, and we have adopted the highest-level languages available for commercial software development today as our preferred environments: Clojure and Haskell. We are not wedded to any of our techniques or tools, instead looking to improve our effectiveness by incrementally adopting new technology if it proves better than what came before it, and as it stabilizes in the market.

### Design ###

Our design team led by Noopur and Varun have experience conducting user research either in the form of surveys, observation of the users' interaction with a prototype or the application (contextual inquiry, task analysis). 

They follow an incremental approach, iterating over multiple approaches and variations, before arriving at the most suitable designs.

### Process and Project Management ###

We are familiar with many different project management styles, in a variety of toolchains[1].  

Our default delivery style is based on the classic Extreme Programming methodologies with 1-week iterations, daily standups, TDD, pair programming, and heavy communication. Progress on individual features/stories/cards would be updated in real time (daily) so stakeholders can watch work in-flight.  

We believe that open lines of communication and planning/projection which employs strict measurement and reduces guesswork are critical to the success of any project. Because of nilenso's offshore and distributed history, we are very comfortable with most asynchronous communication channels.

[1] We have worked with most of the project management tools out there: _Pivotal Tracker_, _Mingle_, _JIRA_, _Trello_, paper-stickies-on-a-wall, and _Github_.  

### Inception ###

An Inception is a high-intensity kickoff to a project, which captures a shared understanding of the high level goals, their priorities, their budgets, and their limitations, which would be useful when development on the next phases of the app (such as the B2B platform), take place. 

The majority of the Inception attempts to capture features (or "user stories", preferably, as these frame each feature in terms of how it benefits the end user), estimate them if necessary, and prioritize them. Whether stories are individually estimated or not, they are then packed into a few sample weeks of the project to rough out the expected pace of development. Stories can be reprioritized as the project progresses and the initial projection will be updated every week with the team's actual rate of progress. The project's scope is adjusted every week accordingly. 

### Tech Stack Considerations ###

The Search functionality referred to earlier is built using React Native (our mobile platform of choice to extend the existing Android and iOS apps).

React Native provides the execution team with a cross-platform framework with a solid industry track record. Cross-platform development for Android and iOS requires that the development team is able to work with lower-level constructs in Java and Objective-C (or Swift) to render applications with a fully native look-and-feel. React Native provides this, providing the best of both worlds: A low-risk, cross-platform environment for speed of development (and thus, experimentation) and native platform code on both Android and iOS where it is needed for integration or performance.

Additionally, React Native brings the world-class immutable object-model rendering framework, which began with ReactJS, to mobile platforms. The value of immutable architectures should not be understated. A modern iPhone contains 4 CPU cores -- heavy multi-threading and careful resource management are no longer the domain of industrial-strength server farms. Beyond modern technical considerations, immutable architectures reduce complexity and failure rates, which in turn reduces development time, maintenance costs, and time spent supporting software in production.

React Native has quickly become a significant player in the mobile market in applications which are not inherently platform-specific (such as games). Applications that are built either using React Native, or that have componenets of both Native Android / iOS as well as React Native:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- AirBnB
- Myntra

[Mention that we will keep that native code as is, talk about other components at the back-end, including build / CI / analytics infra, even briefly?]

## Statement of Work ##

Proposed features (please note this is an indicative sample set, a comprehensive list will be arrived at by speaking to the various stakeholders involved, if required conducting surveys, and building and testing prototypes)

### Proposed Sample Features: Near-Term ###

- Maintenance work including incremental development
- "Spotlight" style search [Appendix]
- Improving the search based on past user queries
- In-app vs google places vs additional search [Appendix 2: Benefits -- Intent based search, Discoverability -- improve accessibility]
- WiFi without signin to allow app download

### Proposed UX improvements: Near-Term ###

- Allow iOS users to swipe back to go to the previous screen (accepted UX behaviour in iOS)
- Allow users to track more than one flight

### Proposed Sample Features: Medium-Term ###

- Flight Check-in
- Booking a bus from and to the airport (including payment)
- Booking a cab from and to the airport (including payment)
- B2B: provide flight status across multiple flights to transport and hospitality industry partners
- B2B: allow service providers at the airport to update their profiles, which will appear in the app (and search) once vetted
- B2B: allow service providers to A/B test their offers across various categories of users
- Update on waiting times for check-in, security (apply predictive modeling for traffic flow)

### Long-Term Vision ###

- Developing a plug-and-play portal for the entire airport ecosystem, including employees, airlines, service providers located at and away from, the airport

## Staffing and Rates ##

To start with, we propose a blended rate of $480/day per person. We propose a team consisting of the following members:

- 1 full-time designer (100% of the week)
- 1 full-time developer (100% of the week)
- 1 part-time architect (25% of the week)

Business Analyst(s) / Project Manager(s) who will not be billed explicitly (their time is accounted for in the blended rate).

So, indicatively, the total monthly billing for the team would be $21,600.

In the future, the team can be augmented based on requirements as well as availability.


## Prototype ##

For the prototype, we chose to:

- Redesign the Flight Tracking functionality.
- Build a Search functionality over the various sections of the application.

### Advantages afforded by the Tracking functionality redesign

- Allow tracking of multiple flights, so different people from different cities can be easily tracked. This would be especially useful to individuals tracking the arrival of their family members (for instance during festivals, or an event such as a wedding) and service providers such as hotels who can aggregate pickups. 
- Introduce a widget on the homescreen for easy access, so the user would not need to look for this information each time.
- Optionally allow the app to give you notifications on a locked screen. This could be very helpful in ensuring that a passenger waiting for the departure of their flight never misses it.

### Advantages afforded by the Search functionality ###

- Ease of use for new users: Currently, the application expects users to navigate through the various categories provided on the home screen (Eat, Facilities) to find what they are looking for. New users who are not already familiar with the layout of the app may find this design difficult to use. Search functionality that cuts across categories offers a powerful advantage to the existing traditional layout.
- Speed of use: This overarching Search functionality allows users who are already familiar with the app to quickly find what they are looking for, and reduce the number of clicks they need to make.
- Intuitive design: The Search allows users to search by words (example: Filter Coffee), rather than click through the various options to find a restaurant that serves filter coffee.
- Analytics: Allowing users to search using keywords of their choice rather than navigating through the app could be a valuable source of information on the expectations of passengers (and eventually other users of the app). This insight can be ploughed back into improving the services provided (both by the airport authority, and other service providers) at the airport.

Eventually, the search functionality can be extended to account for the following:

- Auto-Complete: Performs and refreshes search  for every key entered and suggests probable complete keywords for partially typed keywords.
- Adaptive: Frequently chosen results appear higher in the results list for quicker usage. 
- User History: Most frequent searches of that specific user can appear higher on the list.
- Context Aware: Only those actions that are available with respect to the current selection are shown in the search results (example: domestic vs international passengers).
