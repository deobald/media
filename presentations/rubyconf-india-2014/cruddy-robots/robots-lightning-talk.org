Cruddy Robots

* Why do we write software?
* automation
** Reserving a cab => Ola / Uber
** Talking to people => Twitter, Hangouts
** Shopping => Flipkart / Amazon
** Travel agent => cleartrip (refund example) / kayak
** SIM recharge => paytm / no american equiv
** Paper => forms (Access, dBase, FoxPro)

* These are all businesses
* Why do we start businesses?
* Serving human needs
** food, water (bigbasket)
** clothing, shelter (fab.com, housing.in, homeshickari.com)
** safety (police)
** health (ambulance, hospitals)
** love (okc)

* "Job Creation"
** automation is the opposite of this: a boring, manual, repetetive human "job" becomes the "job" of a computer.
** automation is about creating free time
** most necessary jobs are those found in Richard Scary books (quote)
** if your "automation" requires a human, you're doing it wrong
** automation necessarily implies ubiquitious computing

* CRUD
** human => computer
** push model
** can be satisfied with a script
* "Robots"
** computer => computer => human
** pull model
** requires a long-running service
** human intervention is automation failure
** examples: booking a flight, deciding a price
*** can these not be automated?
*** my time is more valuable than my money; I'd rather a smart computer booked my flight tickets.
*** machine learning is getting us there.
