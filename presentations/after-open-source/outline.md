* why open source?
  - transparency => honesty => trust
  - control
  - ownership => forking
  - datamining is real
    - code librarians?
    - code plumbers
    - code janitors
    - datamining is automated library maintanence
  - habitability

* stallman: not so crazy after all
  - NSA / FBI

* why free software?
  - _philosophy_: focus on the core
  - prevent a backslide
  - prevent loss of transparency/control via other avenues
  - https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software
    -- "the user is free"
    -- why freedom? "a school should prepare citizens to live in a strong, capable, independent, co-operating, and free society"
    -- stallman's diagram => maturity model

* schools, universities, libraries -- free information, free education, free students
  - open documents
    - ophthalmology; software is actually way ahead, which is good because it moves fastest
    - return to pace of tech later

* MIT vs. AGPL
- free to remove the freedom
* LLP vs. Co-operatives
- free to stop co-operating

> "strong"
> "capable"
> "independent"

* resilience - FSF philosophy

* open source / open data (code is data)
  - DataKind
  - DataMeet
  - datamining is real

* Indian software patent policy
  - patents and the pace of tech
* Indian fight for net neutrality
* governments: 18F vs. India
  - BHIM: write to your government -- "I can't because I'm an immigrant."
* patents/neutrality/govt: 3 examples of governance affecting technology; consider reverse (go into politics!)

* independent:
  - intellectual "property" => secrets => lies by omission, then active => mistrust (parallel transparency/honesty/trust)
  - code, information, knowledge is libre AND gratis: services/effort cost money
    - ref "pace of tech" with history

> "free"

* secrets are lies
  - NSA, Russia
  - Japan nukes
  - DeepWater Horizon
* patents eliminate freedom
  - farmer suicide
    - seed diversity (ref The Knowledge?)
  - pharma-related deaths
  - genetics: genes are code (Nat Friedman example)

> "co-operating"

* open org: samanvay
* co-op: nilenso

> "strong, capable, independent, co-operating, free": corporations

* open finances: buffer
* open ai - go board
* open documents
  - LLP agreement
  - backref ophthalmology

* don't get hung up on the problems of 1998
  - change will come: news about MS, Linux, SQL Server, .NET
  - we can also go backward: Xamarin acquired by MS (MS still not a champion of free software)
  - breath:
    - us
    - the universe
    - program vs. protocol:
      - email => gmail => else
      - ShoutCast => RSS/ATOM => Medium
      - chatrooms => IRC => Slack
      - Twitter => ?
      - Facebook => ?

* nothing is boring
  - story: GIS => google maps => OSM
  - patents
  - policy
  - HR
  - government

* Vague concepts: entity/org/society
