- overall: "a lot of little things"
- make applying philosophy elsewhere more explicit
- be careful not to derail when explaining verbally
- some thoughts are difficult to express
- thoughtful visuals
- keep unfamiliar thoughts short

- why open source
- datamining? concrete example
- plumber -> janitor/librarian?
- what if you had code librarians?
- attention might slip due to unfamiliarity
- habitability? -> accessibility?
- difficult to change programs with manual memory management
  - punchcard = past, auto concurrency = future
- the same is true for big monolithic codebases
- manual driving? -- maybe put this on the curve slide, but remove it from this slide
- outer habitability -- very future-focused
- reasons for open source ends at slide 19

- why free software?
- /r/StallmanWasRight
- end this section on slide 27(?)
- slide 28: a school should prepare its citizens to live in a strong, capable, independent, cooperating and free society.


-- next two sections are about governance/policy
- the next few slides feel like a bit of a brain dump
- slides 35-38 ?? (ideas are more viral than any license)
  - can evangelize ideas because tech is adjacent to other industries
- 37-38 in particular feel weird

- 39: strong, capable, independent
- remove 'in the abstract' and 'in the concrete'
- datamining is real
- data is code: (Rich Hickey disagrees) data is not code until you define a language around it
- in the abstract vs in the concrete seem unrelated
- in the concrete: say no to software patents, get into politics (?)
- net neutrality win is something we must continue to fight for
- maybe add modi poster picture?
- conclusion should be 'not us vs them, become them'

- capable
- time is part of the definition of capability
- define: capable
- slides 56-57: patents-related? 
- move earlier software patents slide into here (tshirt flag slide)
- this is the software patents section

- free
- might want to explain deepwater horizon situation
- consider elaborating on patent shittiness
- seed patents: "biological vendor lock-in"

- cooperating
- go board
- keep the quick aside quick
- cooperative agreement fork:
  - co-ops + fork?
  - just fork?
  - skeleton of nilenso + fork?

- the future
- remove slide 76: xamarin stuff
- "everything breathes": things will change, don't get hung up
- change "nothing is boring" to "everything is interesting"
