* Introduction to Experimentation
- Cox and Reid definition of Experimentational Research
- History?
- Usage (much more mature?) in other fields

- Experimentation as we use it
- Coverage
- Reports
- Events
- http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36500.html (call out that the most disruptive paper came out 5 years ago, so it's a relatively new subject, and needs a lot of whiteboarding before jumping in. There aren't established tools/practices out there).
- Google, Bing, LinkedIn & Netflix
- https://github.com/StaplesLabs/HeartofGold/blob/4205a588cdef9abc9d5739ce168532b4560d34a7/docs/hog-api-documentation.org#great-material-on-experimentation-infrastructure

# E A B
# E A B C
# E A A
# E1 E2 (messy)
# E1 E2 (precise)
# messy and precise (old ep style)
# nested trees
# shared bucket

* Magnitude - clojure/jvm?
- let's us focus on the actual problem
- expressiveness

- examples (dispatch table, report-graphs vs figure-graphs, current get-buckets/mutual-recursion?)
#+begin_src clojure
(def dispatch-table
  {[c/precise c/messy]        :default
   [c/precise c/precise]      :precise
   [c/precise c/unrestricted] :unrestricted
   [c/messy   c/messy]        :messy
   [c/messy   c/precise]      :default
   [c/messy   c/unrestricted] :unrestricted})
#+end_src

* Persistence? - postgres

-- The following vars and their curves with increasing db size
- single write - SLA
- cold/warm read - SLA
- report without aggregates - changing data, drill down analysis
- bulk import - profiling
- backup and restore - for archival, safety

(redis, datomic/ddb, datomic/pg, pg)
